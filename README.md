# Henning Heyen Bachelor Project

This project addresses the outcome of no-regret dynamics in finite games. Can the outcome
be characterized by traditional game-theoretic solution concepts like Nash equilibria?
The general answer to this question is no. Nevertheless, there are some games where
Nash convergence under no-regret learning has been observed before. 

The project aims to give a neat and compact overview on sufficient conditions under which no-regret learning
converges to Nash. These conditions are empirically confirmed by employing two concrete
instances of no-regret algorithms on simple two-player games (*Projected Online Gradient Ascent* and *Entropic Gradient Ascent*). Plots are provided further
to give an intuition of the algorithmsâ€™ behavior. 

The bottom line is that only strict Nash equilibria survive under no-regret dynamics. Moreover, the empirical frequency of play
converges to interior Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum games.

Feel free to play around with the code and to add new games (2x2 or 3x3)!
