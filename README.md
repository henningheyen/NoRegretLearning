    1. **TwoTimesTwoGamesFunctions**: code for 2x2 games. Contains both *Projected Online Gradient Ascent* as well as *Entropic Gradient Ascent* algorithms
    2. **ThreeTimesThreeFunctions**: Analog code for 3x3 games
    3. The other files are Jupyter Notebooks where the algorithms are run and visualised on simple 2-Player games
    4. **PayoffMatrices**: Folder that contains images (.jpeg or .png) of the payoff matrices imported at the beginning of each jupyter notebook
