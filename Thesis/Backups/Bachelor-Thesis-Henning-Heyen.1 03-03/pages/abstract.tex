\chapter{\abstractname}

This thesis addresses the outcome of \textit{no-regret} dynamics in finite games. Can the outcome be characterized by traditional game theoretic solution concepts like \textit{Nash equilibria}? The general answer to this question is no. Nevertheless there are some games where \textit{Nash} convergence under \textit{no-regret} learning has been observed before. The thesis aims to give a neat and compact overview on sufficient conditions under which \textit{no-regret} learning converges. These conditions are empirically confirmed by employing two concrete instances of \textit{no-regret} algorithms on simple two player games. Plots are provided to further give an intuition of the algorithms' behavior. The bottom line is that the sequence of play induced by \textit{no-regret} algorithms converge to \textit{strict Nash equlibria} soley and the empirical frequency of play converges to \textit{mixed Nash equilibria} in constant sum games.
