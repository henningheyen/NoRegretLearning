First of all, I would like to thank my advisor Matthias Oberlechner for his outstanding support throughout the past five months. Matthias has spent hours of Zoom meetings with me and always provided valuable feedback. Additionally, I wish to extend my special thanks to my girlfriend, Carolin Echterbeck. She has always encouraged me with this project, especially in the final phase. Lastly, I would like to express my gratitude to my parents, Michaela Temme and Thorsten Heyen, and my sister Svenja Heyen for their unconditional support that goes way beyond this project.
